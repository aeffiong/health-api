# health-api

The Health API uses the GIPHY API to display health related gifs when a button is clicked. When a user clicks on a gif, the gif will start playing. When a user clickers the gif again, the gif will stop playing.
Users can add new topic buttons to the screen by typing in a topic of their choice. Once they click the button they created, the gifs will appear on the screen too!
